This is a re-implementation of the Perl script
[cern-get-sso-cookie](https://github.com/sashabaranov/cern-get-sso-cookie/)
as a Pyhton library. As a bonus, a shell client re-implementing (most
of) the functionality of `cern-get-sso-cookie`, is also provided.

## Prerequisites
This package assumes a working Kerberos and OpenSSL setup, but should be
compatible with both python 2.7 and 3.


## Usage


### Using `cern-get-sso-cookie.py`
